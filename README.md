NMDA spikes in L5 Pyramidal cells - Farinella et al 2014 
--------------------------------------------------------

Model from: *Glutamate-bound NMDARs arising from in vivo-like network activity extend spatio-temporal integration in a L5 cortical pyramidal cell model*
Matteo Farinella, Daniel T. Ruedt, Padraig Gleeson, Frederic Lanore and R. Angus Silver

This paper is currently under review. The model will be added once accepted.

The cell model used is based on: [Synaptic integration in L5 Pyramidal cell, Larkum et al. 2009](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/larkumetal2009)
